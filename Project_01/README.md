# Project 1
Directory for Project 2: Light Up Table Code

This program lights up a table with 5x5 LEDs within. When any object is placed on top of on of these rows, the entire row of LEDs will light up. This is done using photodiodes and LEDs. 
To run this program, run the run.py file. The docs folder contains all of the documents for this project: the presentation with the layout and initial ideas for the project.
